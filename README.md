Creating a digital clock display and alarm system with RaspberryPi and the Pimoroni RainbowHAT

Mostly cobbling this all together on my own. Based on my developing knowledge of Python 
and the examples provided by Pimoroni about their RainbowHAT. I'm sure there are probably inefficiencies in the code
that I am not realizing. Once I have a working prototype I'll return to streamlining some of the code.

Priorities:
- clock functionalities
- digital time display
- alarms for scheduled times (class changes)

Perks:
- rainbow LEDs for decor
- rainbow LEDs for "5 Minute Warning" signal

Uncertainties:
- RainbowHAT buzzer for alarm? or connect to another speaker?
